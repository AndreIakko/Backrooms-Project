# Backrooms-Project

 there are 2 ways to access the backrooms, the first, as we are told by the stories we should glitch and fall under the map, (the script that will manage the entrances and exits from the backrooms made by our @DarkSideOfTheCode, has been designed to intervene only when you fall under the map and not when you fall from great heights like the palaces), the second way to access the backrooms will be to find random points also located around the map.
the backrooms project has been designed to be as faithful as possible to the stories.

made this small premise,
our goal for the backrooms project is to involve as many fivem mappers as possible with their works so as to create more and more levels to add to the project, all creators will also be added to the project credits
